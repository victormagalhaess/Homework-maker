# Homework-maker
Python project that uses Wikipedia-based researches to build 5th grade level homeworks.  
It can generate pretty nice homeworks, as you can see in the examples folder.
In february 2020 Google changed how the images are retrieved and the library that downloads images for the homeworks broke.
I will fix this soon.
To test run the "homework.py" as the entry point. It will ask for some "algorithmia key" go on http://algorithmia.com and create an account to get your key.
The program will ask for some info about the student, (all optional just the language and the theme are mandatory).
It currently works in portuguese and english and need a lot of improvements.
